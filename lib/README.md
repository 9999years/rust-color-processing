# Purpose

This rust library is intended to do some processing of color values.  
It can parse strings in different formats (known color names, hex, rgb, cmyk, hsl, ...) and output color values in different formats. It can also do some basic modifications, like grayscale and colorization.

This library cannot modify images.
